### Application Features

#### REQUIRED FEATURES

- [x] **Display Movies**
  - [x] Users can view a list of current movies from The Movie Database API in a grid view.
    - [x] Movie tiles should be reasonably sized (at least 6 playlists on your laptop when full screen; large enough that the playlist components detailed in the next feature are legible).
  - [x] For each movie displayed, users can see the movie's:
    - [x] Title
    - [x] Poster image
    - [x] Vote average
  - [x] Users can load more current movies by clicking a button which adds more movies to the grid without reloading the entire page.

  - [x] Users can use a search bar to search for movies by title.
  - [x] The search bar should include:
    - [x] Text input field
    - [x] Submit/Search button
    - [x] Clear button
  - [x] Movies with a title containing the search query in the text input field are displayed in a grid view when the user either:
    - [x] Presses the Enter key
    - [x] Clicks the Submit/Search button
  - [x] Users can click the Clear button. When clicked:
    - [x] All text in the text input field is deleted
    - [x] The most recent search results are cleared from the text input field and the grid view and all current movies are displayed in a grid view
- [x] **Design Features**

  - [x] Website implements responsive web design.
    - [x] Uses CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid
    - [x] Movie tiles and images shrink/grow in response to window size

  - [x] Website displays:
    - [x] Header section
    - [x] Banner section
    - [x] Search bar
    - [x] Movie grid
    - [x] Footer section
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: To ease the grading process, please use the [color contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to demonstrate to the grading team that text and background colors on your website have appropriate contrast. The Contrast Ratio should be above 4.5:1 and should have a green box surrounding it. 
- [x] **Planning Documentation**
  - [x] Repository includes a `planning.md` file with:
    - [x] A **Component Architecture** section listing at least 5 components, each with its responsibility, what it renders, and its props.
    - [x] An **API Contracts** section documenting at least 2 TMDb endpoints used, with URL, query parameters, and relevant response fields for each.
    - [x] A **State Architecture** section listing state variables with name, type, initial value, owner component, and what user action triggers an update.
    - [x] A **Data Flow** section (paragraph or diagram) explaining how data flows from the TMDb API response through the component hierarchy to the `MovieCard`, including any transformations.
- [x] **AI Watch Recommendation**
  - [x] When a movie's detail modal is opened, an AI-generated watch recommendation is displayed alongside the movie details.
  - [x] A loading state is shown while the AI response is being generated, and a graceful fallback message is shown if the AI call fails.
  - [x] `planning.md` includes an **AI Feature Spec** documenting role, task, inputs, output format, constraints, and failure behavior for the AI call.
  - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: To ease the grading process, open your browser's DevTools **Network** tab, trigger the AI recommendation (open a movie modal), and show the outbound request going **directly to an AI API URL** (e.g., `openrouter.ai`) — not to a backend server URL. Graders need to see this call in the Network tab to award full credit.

#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - [ ] Website is deployed via Render.
  - [ ] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: For ease of grading, please use the deployed version of your website when creating your walkthrough. 
- [ ] **Embedded Movie Trailers**
  - [ ] Within the pop-up modal displaying a movie's details, the movie trailer is viewable.
    - [ ] When the trailer is clicked, users can play the movie trailer.
- [x] **Favorite Button**
  - [x] For each movie displayed, users can favorite the movie.
  - [x] There should be visual element (such as a heart icon) on each movie's tile to show whether or not the movie has been favorited.
  - [x] If the movie is not favorited:
    - [x] Clicking on the visual element should mark the movie as favorited
    - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the movie has been favorited by the user.
  - [x] If the movie is already favorited:
    - [x] Clicking on the visual element should mark the movie as *not* favorited.
    - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the movie has been unfavorited. 
- [x] **Watched Checkbox**
  - [x] For each movie displayed, users can mark the movie as watched.
  - [x] There should be visual element (such as an eye icon) on each movie's tile to show whether or not the movie has been watched.
  - [x] If the movie has not been watched:
    - [x] Clicking on the visual element should mark the movie as watched
    - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the eye turning a different color) to show that the movie has been watched by the user.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The Weather Report labs prepared me well for component architecture, API integration, and state management, which formed the foundation of this project. However, I felt unprepared for the AI feature integration—prompt engineering and handling asynchronous API calls within React components was new territory. The labs also didn't cover state lifting at the scale needed for the sidebar feature, so figuring out how to manage favorites and watched lists across multiple components required additional research and refactoring.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have implemented localStorage to persist favorites and watched lists across browser sessions, as currently they reset on page reload. I would have also added the embedded YouTube trailers stretch feature and deployed the app to Render so it could be shared publicly. Additionally, I would have refined the sort functionality to work across all paginated results rather than just the currently loaded movies, which would require a different approach to how I fetch and manage movie data.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The luxury aesthetic and featured hero movie layout received positive feedback and really made the app stand out visually from other submissions. The sidebar remove functionality worked seamlessly during the demo, which showcased the thoughtful UX design beyond the basic requirements. One thing I'd like to try next time is adding micro-interactions like the subtle animations I saw in a peer's project—things like loading skeletons for movie cards and staggered fade-ins for the grid would add even more polish to the user experience.
